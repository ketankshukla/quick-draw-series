## GUIDING PRINCIPLES (The 4Cs)

1. **CONTINUITY** -- Every event, character arc, and concept must track across all books. No retcons.
2. **CLARITY** -- Every chapter must be instantly understandable by the target audience. Action first (fiction) or insight first (non-fiction), exposition woven in.
3. **CONSISTENCY** -- Tone, voice, power rules (fiction) or argumentation style (non-fiction), and structure must feel the same across all books.
4. **COHERENCY** -- The overall arc must feel like ONE story/argument told in multiple parts. Each book is complete but also part of the larger journey.

---

## CHARACTER DEATH STRATEGY (Fiction Only)

_Delete this section for non-fiction series._

**Act I:** NO major hero deaths. Build reader investment. Close calls only.
**Act II:** {{ACT_2_DEATHS}} hero deaths. Must be earned, devastating, and meaningful.
**Act III:** {{ACT_3_DEATHS}} hero deaths. Ultimate price of victory.
**Total across series:** {{TOTAL_DEATHS}} maximum.

**Characters who NEVER die:**

- {{PROTECTED_1}} -- {{WHY_PROTECTED_1}}
- {{PROTECTED_2}} -- {{WHY_PROTECTED_2}}

**Death candidates (not confirmed -- to be decided during outlining):**

- {{DEATH_CANDIDATE_1}} -- {{WHY_MIGHT_DIE_1}}
- {{DEATH_CANDIDATE_2}} -- {{WHY_MIGHT_DIE_2}}

---

## NARRATION STYLE

**POV:** {{POV_STYLE}} (e.g., Third person limited / First person / Second person direct address)

**Voice Rules:**

- {{VOICE_RULE_1}} (e.g., Short, punchy sentences in action scenes)
- {{VOICE_RULE_2}} (e.g., Vivid sensory details)
- {{VOICE_RULE_3}} (e.g., Emotional honesty -- characters feel things intensely)
- {{VOICE_RULE_4}} (e.g., Evidence-based claims with real-world examples)

**Sample Voice Targets:**

- **{{VOICE_SAMPLE_NAME_1}}:** {{VOICE_SAMPLE_STYLE_1}} -- _"{{VOICE_SAMPLE_QUOTE_1}}"_
- **{{VOICE_SAMPLE_NAME_2}}:** {{VOICE_SAMPLE_STYLE_2}} -- _"{{VOICE_SAMPLE_QUOTE_2}}"_

---

## BOOK TITLE FORMAT

**Format:** {{TITLE_FORMAT}} (e.g., [Series Name] Book [N]: [Main Title] -- [Subtitle])

- **Main title** = evocative, intriguing, sounds epic
- **Subtitle** = clear, tells the reader what to expect

---

## CHAPTER CLIFFHANGERS (Fiction) / CHAPTER HOOKS (Non-Fiction)

### Within Each Book (Chapter-to-Chapter)

Rotate between these types:

**Fiction:**

- **Danger** -- character in immediate peril
- **Revelation** -- shocking information revealed
- **Emotional** -- relationship rupture or sacrifice
- **Mystery** -- something unexplained happens
- **Action** -- mid-battle cut to another POV
- **Arrival** -- someone or something unexpected appears

**Non-Fiction:**

- **Question** -- pose a compelling question that the next chapter answers
- **Contradiction** -- present a counterintuitive finding
- **Promise** -- preview a powerful insight coming next
- **Challenge** -- issue a direct challenge to the reader
- **Story** -- begin an anecdote that continues in the next chapter

### Between Books (Book-to-Book)

- Book ends with major resolution BUT bigger question/threat revealed
- Book ends with a transformation that demands continuation
- **The last line of every book should be a gut-punch**

---

## SERIES EPILOGUE

**Approach:** {{EPILOGUE_APPROACH}} (e.g., Time Skip + Passing the Torch / Synthesis + Call to Action)

**Requirements:**

- Inspiring -- reader finishes feeling empowered
- Full of lessons learned
- Emotionally satisfying -- every arc resolved
- Earned and bittersweet -- not saccharine
- NOT a cliffhanger -- the main conflict/question is RESOLVED

**Every book's epilogue** = cliffhanger/hook + "What Comes Next" tease
**Series finale epilogue** = inspiring conclusion + sequel series tease

---

## BOOK STRUCTURE (Per Book)

Each book contains:

```

13. Generate cover images
14. Create box set covers and descriptions
15. Final 4Cs review across the entire series

### LESSONS LEARNED

**Chapter writing workflow:**

- Write chapters as individual UTF-8 markdown files using PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8`
- Each chapter file starts with a title line: `Chapter [N] - [TITLE IN CAPS]`
- Write one chapter per AI response to avoid file conflicts and maintain quality
- Commit and push after completing each book (not each chapter)

**Front matter files per book:**

- `copyright.md` -- standard copyright, ISBN placeholder, publisher info
- `dedication.md` -- personal dedication
- `epigraph.md` -- thematic quote (can be from the story's world for fiction)
- `dramatis_personae.md` -- character list organized by faction/role (fiction only)
- `preface.md` -- author's preface (non-fiction only)
- `introduction.md` -- book introduction (non-fiction only)
- `prologue.md` -- narrative opening (non-fiction only)

**Back matter files per book:**

- `also_by.md` -- list of other books by the author
- `about_the_author.md` -- author biography
- `authors_note.md` -- reflection on themes and process for this book
- `connect.md` -- website, email, newsletter signup
- `review_request.md` -- reader review request with gratitude
- `epilogue.md` -- closing narrative (non-fiction only)

**DOCX generation:**

- Use a PowerShell script that combines all chapter `.md` files into one DOCX via Pandoc
- Use `pageBreakBefore` on chapter heading paragraphs (raw OpenXML) to avoid blank pages
- Do NOT use standalone page break paragraphs -- they cause blank pages when chapter content aligns with page boundaries
- Verify every generated DOCX for blank pages using Word

**File naming conventions:**

- Book folders: `Book [NN] - [Title] - [Subtitle]`
- Chapter files: `chapter_[NN]_[slug_with_underscores].md`
- Chapter summaries: `chapter_[NN]_summary.md`
- Book summary: `book_[NN]_summary.md`
