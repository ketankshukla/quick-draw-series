# A Quick Favor

Thank you for reading **{{SERIES_NAME}} Book {{BOOK_NUMBER}}: {{BOOK_TITLE}}**.

If this book resonated with you, the single most helpful thing you can do is leave an honest review on Amazon. Reviews are the lifeblood of independent publishing -- they help other readers discover the series, and they help me continue writing.

Even a brief review makes a tremendous difference.

**How to leave a review:**
1. Go to the book's page on Amazon
2. Scroll down to "Customer Reviews"
3. Click "Write a customer review"
4. Share your honest thoughts -- even a sentence or two helps

Thank you for your time, your trust, and your support. It means more than you know.
