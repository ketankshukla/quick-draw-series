# End-to-End Workflow: Creating a New Book Series from Template

## Overview

This document describes the complete, reusable workflow for generating a new book series project from the `book-series-template` repository. The process has **four main phases** and only **one manual step** (generating cover images from prompts).

### The Four Phases

1. **Clone & Initialize** — Clone template repo, set up fresh git, create client request file from template
2. **Generate Content Blueprint** — Cascade reads the client request → generates `{series-name}-content-generation-details.md` (the giant detailed specification)
3. **Generate All Content** — Cascade reads the blueprint → generates every text-based asset: full book chapters, front/back matter, website code, Amazon metadata, image prompts
4. **Image Generation & Deploy** — Manually generate cover images from prompts, then build and push

### Key Terminology

- **Client Request Template** (`client-request-template.md`) — The blank fillable template that ships with every clone. The client copies this and fills it in.
- **Client Request** (`{series-name}-client-request.md`) — The completed client request file. Contains all series information, preferences, and constraints. Stored in the project root.
- **Content Generation Details** (`{series-name}-content-generation-details.md`) — The comprehensive specification Cascade generates FROM the client request. Contains every detail needed to produce the actual content: full character roster, chapter-by-chapter outlines, front/back matter, Amazon metadata, website customization, and image prompts. Also stored in the project root.
- **Book Content** — The actual chapter text, front matter files, back matter files, website source code, and publishing metadata that Cascade generates FROM the content generation details.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22+ installed
- **Git** and **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- **Cascade** (Windsurf AI) available
- **ChatGPT Plus** subscription (for image generation)
- The `book-series-template` repo exists at `https://github.com/ketankshukla/book-series-template`

---

## The Client Request: Complete Template

The client request is the **only input from the client**. Everything else is generated by Cascade. The blank template (`client-request-template.md`) ships with every clone. The client copies it to `{series-name}-client-request.md` and fills it in.

Below is the complete template. Every field marked **(REQUIRED)** must be filled in by the client. Fields marked **(OPTIONAL)** will be intelligently generated by Cascade if left blank.

## Phase 1: Clone & Initialize

### 1.1 Clone the Template

```powershell
# Replace "quick-draw-series" with the PROJECT NAME from the creative brief
gh repo clone ketankshukla/book-series-template E:\quick-draw-series
```

### 1.2 Remove Template Git History and Reinitialize

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force E:\quick-draw-series\.git
Set-Location E:\quick-draw-series
git init
```

### 1.3 Create the Client Request File

Copy `client-request-template.md` to `{series-name}-client-request.md` and fill in all fields:

```powershell
Copy-Item client-request-template.md quick-draw-series-client-request.md
```

```
E:\quick-draw-series\
├── client-request-template.md       ← BLANK TEMPLATE (ships with clone)
├── quick-draw-series-client-request.md  ← CLIENT INPUT (filled in)
├── package.json
├── src/
└── ...
```

### 1.4 Open in Windsurf

Open the project folder `E:\quick-draw-series` in Windsurf IDE.

---

## Phase 2: Generate the Content Generation Details File

Tell Cascade:

```
Read {series-name}-client-request.md in this project root. Using ONLY the information
in that file, generate a comprehensive content generation details file named
{series-name}-content-generation-details.md (e.g., quick-draw-series-content-generation-details.md).

This file must contain ALL of the following sections, fully fleshed out from the brief:

 1. Client & project information
 2. Series overview, tagline, and concept expansion
 3. Complete series structure (acts/phases, themes per book, arc progression)
 4. Full character roster (10-20 characters with names, roles, descriptions,
    relationships, arc summaries, and first/last book appearances)
 5. Romance arc details (if applicable)
 6. Death strategy and character fate table
 7. For EACH book: title, subtitle, per-book accent color (hex), epigraph,
    short description (1 paragraph), elaborate description (3-5 paragraphs),
    and a chapter-by-chapter outline (chapter title + 3-5 sentence summary per chapter)
 8. Front matter content for all books: copyright template, dedication per book,
    epigraph per book, dramatis personae per book (listing characters who appear)
 9. Back matter content: About the Author, Also By, Author's Note per book
    (unique, reflecting that book's themes), Connect With the Author, Review Request
10. Amazon publishing metadata: ebook/paperback pricing, KDP Select status,
    HTML book description per book, KDP categories, 7 keywords per book,
    series-level Amazon description
11. Website customization: full CSS color scheme (all variables), metadata
    (title, description, OG tags, keywords), author section data, navigation
    labels, image file paths, Amazon buy-link placeholders
12. Image prompts: 3 detailed cover art prompt variations per book (matching
    the visual style and color palette from the brief). Each prompt must be a
    complete, standalone prompt ready to paste into ChatGPT — including dimensions,
    art style, composition, color palette with hex codes, typography spec, and
    mood description. All prompts share the same typography and color identity but
    depict COMPLETELY DIFFERENT images per book.

Save the file in the project root. Do NOT generate any other files yet.
```

### What Cascade Produces in Phase 2

A single, massive markdown file (typically 800-1200 lines) that serves as the **complete blueprint** for Phase 3. This file is the equivalent of `example-deliverables-western-series.md` in the metronagon repo — but generated automatically from the client request instead of written by hand.

---

## Phase 3: Generate All Content

This is the largest phase. Tell Cascade:

```
Read {series-name}-content-generation-details.md in this project root. Using that file
as the single source of truth, generate ALL of the following:

PART A — BOOK CONTENT (chapters)
For every book in the series, generate full chapter text as markdown files:
  book-series/{book-folder}/chapters/chapter-01.md through chapter-{N}.md
Each chapter must be {word-count-range} words, written in {POV} point of view,
matching the tone and style described in the content generation details.

PART B — FRONT MATTER (per book)
  book-series/{book-folder}/front_matter/00-title-page.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/front_matter/01-copyright.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/front_matter/02-dedication.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/front_matter/03-epigraph.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/front_matter/04-dramatis-personae.md

PART C — BACK MATTER (per book)
  book-series/{book-folder}/back_matter/authors-note.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/back_matter/about-the-author.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/back_matter/also-by.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/back_matter/connect.md
  book-series/{book-folder}/back_matter/review-request.md

PART D — AMAZON PUBLISHING
  amazon-publishing-template.md (with real HTML book descriptions)
  book-series/series-description.md
  book-series/kdp-categories-and-keywords.md

PART E — WEBSITE SOURCE CODE
  src/data/books.ts (all books with real data)
  src/data/characters.ts (full character roster)
  src/app/globals.css (series color scheme)
  src/app/layout.tsx (series metadata)
  All components: Header.tsx, Hero.tsx, Footer.tsx, AuthorSection.tsx,
    BooksSection.tsx, BookCard.tsx, BookModal.tsx — replace all placeholders

PART F — IMAGE PROMPTS
  book-prompts/ebook-covers/book-1-cover-prompt.txt (all 3 variations)
  book-prompts/ebook-covers/book-2-cover-prompt.txt
  ... (one file per book containing all 3 variations)
  book-prompts/series-logo-prompt.txt
  book-prompts/hero-image-prompt.txt

PART G — PROJECT FILES
  README.md — REPLACE the template README entirely with a project-specific README
    that includes: series name, author name, series description, book list with
    titles/subtitles, tech stack, quick start commands, project structure showing
    actual book directories, deployment info, and links. This is NOT the template
    README — it is a series-specific project README.
  book-series-plan.md (filled in with real series plan)
  video-prompts/heygen-trailer-template.md (customized for this series)
  video-scripts/book-marketing-template/marketing-video-script.md (customized)

After generating all files, run: npm install && npm run build
Verify the build succeeds. Then commit and push to GitHub.
```

### What Cascade Produces in Phase 3

Below is the **complete file manifest** — every file that exists after Phase 3:

## Phase 4: Image Generation & Deploy

### 4.1 Generate Cover Images (MANUAL — the only manual step)

For each book:

1. Open the prompt file from `book-prompts/ebook-covers/book-{N}-cover-prompt.txt`
2. Copy-paste **Variation A** into ChatGPT → generate image
3. Copy-paste **Variation B** into ChatGPT → generate image
4. Copy-paste **Variation C** into ChatGPT → generate image
5. Select the best result
6. Save as `book{N}-cover.png`

Also generate from the prompt files:

- **Series logo** → `series-logo-{series-name}.png`
- **Hero/landscape image** → `complete-series-cover-landscape.png`
- **Author photo** → `{author-name}.jpeg` (or use client-provided photo)

Place all images in:

```
public/images/
├── series-logo-{series-name}.png
├── complete-series-cover-landscape.png
├── book1-cover.png
├── book2-cover.png
├── book3-cover.png
├── book4-cover.png
├── book5-cover.png
└── {author-name}.jpeg
```

### 4.2 Final Build & Push

Tell Cascade:

```
The cover images have been added to public/images/. Run npm run build to verify
everything compiles, then commit all changes and push to GitHub.
```

Cascade will:

1. Run `npm run build` — verify site compiles with real images
2. `git add .` → `git commit` → `git push`
3. Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub

### 4.3 Verify the Live Site

1. Check Vercel dashboard for successful deployment
2. Visit the live URL and verify:
   - Series logo and hero image display correctly
   - All book covers are visible and properly sized
   - Book modals open with correct chapter listings and descriptions
   - Author section shows correct bio and photo
   - Footer links and navigation work
   - Mobile responsiveness is correct
   - Amazon buy links point to correct placeholders (or live URLs if published)

### 4.4 Generate Word Documents (OPTIONAL)

If the client needs DOCX files for Amazon KDP upload or personal editing:

```powershell
# Generate individual book DOCX files
Set-Location E:\quick-draw-series\book-series\word-docs
.\make_book_docx.ps1

# Or generate complete DOCX with front/back matter and TOC
.\make_complete_docx.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cascade ran out of context generating chapters"

Chapter generation for large series (50+ chapters) requires multiple Cascade sessions. If context is exhausted mid-generation:

1. Note which chapters have been completed
2. Start a new Cascade session
3. Tell Cascade: "Continue generating chapters. The following are complete: [list]. Start from chapter-{N} of book-{M}."

### "Build fails after code generation"

Common causes:

- **Missing import** — Tell Cascade to run `npm run build` and fix any TypeScript errors
- **Placeholder not replaced** — Search for `{{` in all `.tsx` files and replace any remaining placeholders
- **Image path mismatch** — Verify image filenames in `public/images/` match paths in `books.ts` and component files

### "Amazon description HTML is malformed"

The HTML book descriptions in `amazon-publishing-template.md` should be tested by pasting into Amazon KDP's description editor in preview mode before publishing.

## Quick Reference: The Two Cascade Prompts

### Prompt 1 (Phase 2): Client Request → Content Generation Details

```
Read {series-name}-client-request.md and generate {series-name}-content-generation-details.md
with complete series structure, characters, chapter outlines, front/back matter,
Amazon metadata, website customization, and 15 image prompts (3 per book).
```

### Prompt 2 (Phase 3): Content Generation Details → All Content

```
Read {series-name}-content-generation-details.md and generate ALL book chapters,
front/back matter, website source code, Amazon publishing files, image prompt
files, and marketing templates. Then build and push to GitHub.
```

### Prompt 3 (Phase 4): After Images → Final Deploy

```
Images are in public/images/. Build, commit, and push.
```

That's it. Three prompts + image generation = complete book series project.
